The files mp/src/utils/{vbsp,vvis,vrad}/CMakeLists.txt are there for example purposes only since 
they will not compile with haunt they way it is not. The only repo they will build with now is
found here 

https://github.com/sortie/source-sdk-2013/tree/for-valve-posix-port-vbsp-vvis-vrad

it is in his for-valve-posix-port-vbsp-vvis-vrad branch. Also the LINK_LIBS needs to be modified
to point to the sdks libraries located at {SDK_ROOT}/mp/src/libs/public/linux32 so you will have
to adjust it to point to them with an absoulute path.
